#Quick Sort
#Quick Sort is an inplace sort in its different version
#It sort the elements by arranging all the smaller elements to its one side and bigger element to the other side by comparing with a pivot
#Time complexity is Î¸(nlogn) and O(n*n) and Auxilary Space required is O(n) during recursion
